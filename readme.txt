howTransformationsWork portrays and gives proof about what goes on with transformations in 2D in processing. Basically transformations take effect in a sequential order. That is to say that each new transformation in the matrix stack applies to the coordinate system established by the preceding transformation. Also, it helps the user to note that the pushMatrix() function 'saves' the current coordinate system, for the sake of naming "a", and allows to make as many new transformations, starting with that coordinate system of "a", as wanted; then the function popMatrix() returns the coordinate system as to that of "a", leaves everything as before pushing. This process can be nested.
